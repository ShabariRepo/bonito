## 1. Agent Marketplace (AppExchange for Bonobots)
- **Date:** 2026-02-26
- **Concept:** Shared marketplace where companies publish, discover, and install pre-built Bonobot agents
- **Model:** Install with one click, runs on YOUR cloud (not the publisher's)
- **Revenue:** Revenue share with agent creators, listing fees, or premium tier
- **Why wait:** Needs critical mass of customers building agents first
- **Inspiration:** Salesforce AppExchange, Shopify App Store, but for AI agents
- **Network effect:** More agents listed = more customers attracted = more agents built

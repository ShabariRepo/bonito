## FAQ

### What counts as a gateway request?
Any API call routed through the Bonito gateway proxy (the OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Direct cloud console usage via Bonito's dashboard does not count toward gateway limits.

### Can I switch plans?
Yes. Upgrade anytime; downgrades take effect at the next billing cycle. No long-term commitment on Free or Pro.

### Do you offer annual discounts?
Enterprise is annual by default. For Pro, annual billing is available at $4,990/year (2 months free). Contact us for details.

### What happens if I exceed my gateway request limit?
On Free, requests are throttled. On Pro, overage is billed at $0.001/request. On Enterprise, usage-based pricing is agreed during contracting.

### Is there a startup discount?
Yes — we offer 50% off Pro for the first year for startups with <$5M in funding. Contact us.
